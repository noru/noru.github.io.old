Quote from __Javascript - The Definitive Guide 6th Edition:

> The name "cookie" does not have a lot of significance, but it is not used without precedent. In the annals of computing history, the term "cookie" or "magic cookie" has been used to refer to a small chunk of data, particularly a chunk of privileged or secret data, akin to a password, that proves identity or permits access. In JavaScript, cookies are used to save state and can establish a kind of identity for a web browser. Cookies in JavaScript do not use any kind of cryptography, however, and are not secure in any way (although transmitting them across an 'https:' helps).
