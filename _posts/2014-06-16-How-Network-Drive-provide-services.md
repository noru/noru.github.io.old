Inspired by [this artical](http://www.admin10000.com/document/4321.html).   
It's not rocket science, however it explain something.   

### 1. No One Uses All Their Spaces    
> Everybody knows that...
   
### 2. Cluster Repository: Spread it out      
> Your space seems continuous, but it doesn't have to be on Server side. That is, your data is stored dispersively on the disks along with the others'. This ensure the utilization and elasticity of the server. Imagine, you don't have to preserve space for every user and simply add hard drives when the space is run out. 
   
### 3. Duplicated Data: Hash it, hash it, hash it!      
> They tricked you, in a good way though. Many users stored the very same data in there repository but it's only one (or numberable, I don't know) copy there. All you have to do is hash the data(without the file name). The trick is, they let your device do the heavy lifting(no so heavy in fact), with a so called upload plug-in, the data was hashed using your own resources. The devious bitch, well done!

I'm sure there are more optimizations, and even more on going. Let the cloud hit harder LOL.
