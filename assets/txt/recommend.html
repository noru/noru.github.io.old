    Xiu Zhu has demonstrated tremendous aptitude for programming &amp; debugging. He has taken complex projects, especially with legacy code and managed to fix critical bugs and make business relevant enhancements within a short period of time. For e.g. on the development of ExtractRes (Babel tool) he was quick to learn the code, identify the source of the bugs &amp; fix them. He also made few critical enhancements which were instrumental in increasing the automation coverage to new products from M&amp;E division.&nbsp;

    <strong>Communication &amp; Teamwork:&nbsp;</strong>

    Xiu Zhu has excellent written and verbal communication skills. He knows how &amp; when to choose the right channel of communication. For e.g. during the ExtractRes development he constantly asked for Clarifications via email/communicator and at times choose to have a phone call to drill down to the exact requirements. He also has a very easy going approach that makes him an excellent team player.

    Xiu Zhu has shown high appetite for learning, when given with a new task/technology, he dives straight into research and familiarizes himself with the basics. His ramp-up time from research/learning to productivity is very short which makes him an invaluable asset &amp; a go-getter.

    <strong>Recommendation from&nbsp;</strong><em>Alex Xie</em><strong>, Former Project Manager in ACRD</strong>

<p class="p2" style="word-wrap: break-word; font-family: &#39;sans serif&#39;, tahoma, verdana, helvetica; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; white-space: normal;">
    Dear Sir/Madam:
</p>
<p class="p2" style="word-wrap: break-word; font-family: &#39;sans serif&#39;, tahoma, verdana, helvetica; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; white-space: normal;">
    I am a project manager of Autodesk Chinese Research and Development Center and in charge of localization testing team. Zhu Xiu has been working as intern in my team from Oct. 2010 to present, directly reporting to me.&nbsp;
</p>
<p class="p2" style="word-wrap: break-word; font-family: &#39;sans serif&#39;, tahoma, verdana, helvetica; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; white-space: normal;">
    Zhu engaged in many formal testing tasks during about one year internsâ€™ period. In working, his most outstanding capabilities impressed me are extremely strong quick-learning and research capability to solve problems. I always assigned the hardest work to him and he never made me disappointed.&nbsp; Because of his excellent performance on tasks, Zhu Xiu won the most excellent intern award in my team.&nbsp;
</p>
<p class="p2" style="word-wrap: break-word; font-family: &#39;sans serif&#39;, tahoma, verdana, helvetica; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; white-space: normal;">
    Besides outstanding individual problem-solving skills, Zhu showed good team work spirit to cooperate with other colleges very well and always helped team members actively. I am confident to say he is one of the best interns out of total 26 interns.&nbsp;
</p>
<p class="p2" style="word-wrap: break-word; font-family: &#39;sans serif&#39;, tahoma, verdana, helvetica; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; white-space: normal;">
    In brief, Zhu Xiu grew up quickly from a student to a professional QA who can complete formal task independently. I highly recommend Zhu for employment as his advantages including excellent problem-solving skill, highly commitment and good team work spirit will make a great asset to any organization.&nbsp;
